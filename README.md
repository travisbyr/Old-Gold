# Old-Gold

<h4>Idea</h4>

Old Gold is a python console based 2 player game that I created as a final project in 2019.

The aim of the game is to be the first person to remove the gold coin '0'. In order to move a coin there cannot be any silver coins 'O' to the left of it. Coins can only be moved to the left and cannot jump over each other. To remove a coin enter '1' For the coin to be removed, it must be in the first square of the grid. To select a coin to be moved, type the number that is under the coin that you want to select. To move the coin, enter how many places you want the coin to move to the left.
